# eJPT

This is my prep study guide for the eJPT certification. I'll be posting on this repository all my notes and resources I use in order to prepeare myself to earn this cybersecurity certification.

On this README.md you will find all considerations and important info. The index has the links to the multiple pages that make up this study notes, sorted as the contents appear on INE's training guide, which you can find [here](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/courses/309de2a5/penetration-testing-prerequisites).

Here I will also post some HackTheBox retired machines writeups of machines I solve to train for the practical test.
